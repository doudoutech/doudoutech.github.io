At doudou.tech we believe technology should be simple, easy to use and
accessible for all people.

We focus on the user first through the whole process of software creation.

We work incrementally and focus on continously improving the user experience.

We work hard to make the most challenging tasks appear simple.

We embrace constraints to force us to be creative in our solutions.

We understand resources are limited and we must make efficient use of them.

## What do we offer?

### Counseling

We can help small businesses that lack experience to make the right
technological decisions.

We can design strategic plans, validate new ideas, build prototypes and do
feasibility studies, find the right vendors, etc.

### Product Building

We help turn your ideas into code, ship them and grow them.

We can build a proof of concept to validate your idea, help you develop it and
handle the initial growth phase and when you're ready we'll help you build your
own team and transfer all technical knowledge.

### Cloud migration & scale up

We specialize in transitioning legacy applications to the cloud and leverage its
capabilities so they can better handle user growth.

We understand the constraints of successful applications and the technical debt
you surely have. We work hard to ensure your existing processes are impacted the
least. We focus on providing a secure migration path and roll changes
progressively so your teams can learn and adapt.

### Rescue Projects

We can help put your "legacy" projects back in shape.

We're specialized in Ruby on Rails and Nodejs based projects.

We'll do a complete audit of the project, including all software and
infrastructure and implement a plan to bring it back to a stable state.
