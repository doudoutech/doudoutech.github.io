At doudou.tech we focus on the user through the whole process of software
creation.

We believe technology should be simple, easy to use and accessible for all
people.

We work incrementally and focus on continously improving the user experience.

We work hard to make the most challenging tasks appear simple.

We focus on software being accessible to reach to most people.

We embrace constraints to force us to be creative in our approach.

We understand resources are limited and we must make efficient use of them.

## What do we offer?

### Counseling

We can help small businesses that lack experience to make the right
technological decisions.

We can design strategic plands, validate new ideas, build prototypes and do
feasibility studies, find the right vendors, etc.

### Product Building

To build applications that reflect our values, we integrate all parts of the
stack, mobile, frontend, backend, infrastructure, etc.

### Rescue Projects

We can help put your "legacy" projects back in shape.

we're specialized in Ruby on Rails and Nodejs based projects.

We'll do a complete audit of the project, including all software and
infrastructure and implement a plan to bring it back to a stable state.
